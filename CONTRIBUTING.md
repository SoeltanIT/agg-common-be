# Contributing

## General Guideline

### Rules
- Don't edit the signature of the functions, such as parameters and return values unless it's a bug or unused. Please use version control to manage changes.
- Write clear declarative comments for the code.
- Write unit tests for the functions.
- Write clear usage in the README.md file.

### Committing

We are applying [conventional commit spec](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) here. In short, that means a commit has to be one of the following types:

Your commit type must be one of the following:

- **feat**: A new feature.
- **fix**: A bug fix.
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
- **chore**: Changes to the build process, configuration, dependencies, CI/CD pipelines, or other auxiliary tools and libraries.
- **docs**: Documentation-only changes.
- **test**: Adding missing or correcting existing tests.

If you are unfamiliar with the usage of conventional commits,
the short version is to simply specify the type as a first word,
and follow it with a colon and a space, then start your message
from a lowercase letter, like this:

```
feat: add a 'foo' type support
```
